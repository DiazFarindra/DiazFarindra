## 🚀 About Me.

### Hi, I'm Diaz.

a Software Engineer and Tech Enthusiast. I am profoundly interested in human-computer interface (UI/UX) Design, Web Development, and everything in between.

I have experience in Web Development using the Laravel Framework and have several technologies that I have worked with such as MySQL, MongoDB, Git, NodeJS, and Javascript. and of course, i really want to learn more about modern Technology Stack.

⚙️ Tech Stack that I used before for Web Dev :
PHP Laravel Framework (Back End), HTML/CSS/Bootstrap/Tailwind, and React/NextJS (Front End)

I also like my fair share of visual arts and creativity.

this is how you can reach me anytime!
